## General info

This is a simple hangman game I made with Python. If you have any word or wordlists you want me to add, just submit a pull request.



## Usage
Run this command in CMD, terminal or PowerShell (if you don't already have the following modules installed):
```
pip install ipython

pip install pillow

pip install requests

pip install googledrivedownloader

pip install pandas

pip install openpyxl

```
I recommend running it in Google Colabortory so you do not need to install all the modules: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pHTggOfU2BRPalq_vV7miqcCiEvtgAnZ?usp=sharing
